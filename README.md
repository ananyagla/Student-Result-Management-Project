* Interactive dashboards for easy navigation
* LocalStorage-based data saving (no backend required)
* Modal-based forms for smooth user interaction
* Modern UI with clean card layouts and tab-based navigation
* Separate CSS modules for structured styling (`style.css`, `style_section.css`, `style2.css`)

## **Pages Included**

* `index.html` – Landing page
* `dashboard.html` – Student management
* `section.html` – Section management
* `result.html` – Result management
